Stem mastering is a mix between mixing and mastering.
 
Stem mastering is the best option to perfect your mix, because it is a mastering technique with greater scope and fine-tuning options. Send up to 6 tracks of grouped instrument tracks - such as drums, kick, bass, synth, FX or vocals. All of these grouped stems are processed separately.
 
The mastering is then optimized for streaming, CD, download stores and club sound. Order your Stem Mastering service now if you want a perfect mastering for your music.
