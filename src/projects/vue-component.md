### Recording

I record your voice with excellent equipment, which consists of a Neumann TLM 67, as well as various pre amps (Neve, Bae, Manley). This is processed with an analog Pultec EQ and other plugins.
You will also be in a perfectly linear recording studio with a versatile engineer who will take your vocals to the next level.

### Tuning

Through various audio plugins your sounds will always be on the perfect pitch. 
Antares Autotune is very popular for automatic tuning.
But I also use Melodyne and RX7, as well as other UAD plugins.

### Prices

Recording rates: 60â‚¬/h (first session mixing and tuning included, and the first two hours free of charge)

Prices for tuning: 20â‚¬ per song
