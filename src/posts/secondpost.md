### Univeral Audio Plugins

The [UAD](https://www.uaudio.de/uad-plugins.html) Powered Plug-ins

This culminated some time later in the first UAD Powered Plug-ins, a DSP-based platform that has led to the most authentic recreations of analog recording classics and is now used in many leading recording studios. In addition to continuing to develop and manufacture high-quality outboard equipment, Universal Audio's product catalog has also included audio interfaces since 2012, most notably the Apollo interfaces, which are available in a wide variety of sizes and connection types and are used by the world's most renowned producers and artists.

### Waves Audio Plugins

Anyone who deals with the topic of audio production or audio processing will hardly get past the plug-ins from [Waves](https://www.waves.com). The manufacturer is a legend in the digital world, you could also say: a dinosaur. In the distant past, in October 1992, the first plug-in came onto the market, the Q10 Paragraphic Equalizer. It still exists today. And that has its reasons. The plug-ins change a lot of things in the mix for the better, but they keep a low profile.
In many cases, legendary analog hardware serves as a model. Waves has the claim to surpass classic effects units, mixers or tape recorders in terms of sound. Of course, this is also marketing slang. But one must admit: The digital version often comes eerily close to the original.

### Fabfilter Plugins

The Dutch company [Fabfilter Software Instruments](https://www.fabfilter.com/products) was founded in 2002 by Frederik Slijkerman and Floris Klinkert in Amsterdam. Their affinity for analog audio technology brings the two to the development of professional software plug-ins, which should not show off by graphic analogy to old and well-known devices, but should shine with high-quality sound and modern techniques. 
Thought, done, they sat down together and create effects until today, which convince many users worldwide by their graphics, but especially by their results in the application.
