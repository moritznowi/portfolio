### Standard Lease

Leasing beats remain permanently available. Any number of artists can purchase a leasing license and use the beat commercially. Here it is already clear that you give up a large part of the control over your song. 

### Exclusiv Lease

With the exclusive right of use (i.e. the "Exclusive"), you alone receive the right to use the beat. If necessary, an additional use by the author (producer) can be regulated contractually. However, other artists / companies cannot acquire any rights to the beat and cannot use it.
