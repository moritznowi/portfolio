Hi! My name is Moritz and I've been producing music for 7 years. 
I studied Audio Engineering in Munich and since then I produced several singles with different artists from all over the world. I work with [Pro Tools](https://www.avid.com), [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com), [Luna](https://www.uaudio.de/luna.html) & [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com).
2020 I have fulfilled a dream, idem I have constructed my own recording studio. I have since been mixing, mastering and recording music in a wide variety of genres.
