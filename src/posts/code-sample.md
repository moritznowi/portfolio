### What are LUFS?

LUFS stands for Loudness Units relative to Full Scale. It is a normalized measurement of audio loudness that combines human perception and electrical signal intensity. LUFS is used to set targets for audio normalization in film and television, radio, and streaming music.

This may sound complicated, but it simply means that LUFS are the most current and accurate way to measure audio loudness.

This may seem simplistic, but using LUFS for loudness carries important consequences that everyone who produces music should understand.
